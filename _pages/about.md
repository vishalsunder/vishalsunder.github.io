I am a PhD student in computer science at the Ohio State University since August 2019. My research interests include Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing.

Prior to joining OSU, I was a Researcher at TCS Innovation Labs, Delhi, where I worked in the Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence group. I was supervised by [Dr. Gautam Shroff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautam-shroff-066901/) and [Dr. Lovekesh Vig](https://sites.google.com/site/lovekeshhome/).
 
From 2012-2016, I was an undergraduate student of Electrical Engineering in IIT-BHU, Varanasi. Here I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Gopal Sharma](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/eee/people/gsharmaeee).

Apart from work, I am also interested in Yoga and Meditation. I am a registered practitioner of the YSS techniques of Yoga. Find out more [here](https://www.yssofindia.org/meditation/The-Kriya-Yoga-Path-of-Meditation-Yogoda-Satsanga-Society).
