I am a Researcher at TCS Innovation Labs, Delhi, where I work in the Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence group. I am supervised by [Dr. Gautam Shroff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautam-shroff-066901/) and [Dr. Lovekesh Vig](https://sites.google.com/site/lovekeshhome/).

My research interests include:
* Deep Learning and its applications in Natural Language Processing.
* Reinforcement Learning and its applications in multi agent communication/collaboration.

Recently, I have been fascinated by the possibility of grounded language emergence in deep learning agents through interaction and usage of Reinforcement Learning and see it as possibly a new way of synthesizing known and unknown languages. Some good recent papers on the topic: [Multi Agent Cooperation and the Emergence of (Natural) Language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07182.pdf), [Emergence of Language with Multi-agent Games: Learning to Communicate with Sequences of Symbols](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.11192.pdf), [Emergent Communication through Negotiation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03980.pdf), [Emergent Translation in Multi-Agent Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06922), [Understanding Grounded Language Learning Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09867).

Before joining TCS Innovation Labs, I was an undergraduate student of Electrical Engineering in IIT-BHU, Varanasi from 2012-2016. Here I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Gopal Sharma](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/eee/people/gsharmaeee).

Apart from work, I am also interested in Yoga and Meditation. In particular, I practice KriyaYoga. Find out more [here](https://www.yssofindia.org/meditation/The-Kriya-Yoga-Path-of-Meditation-Yogoda-Satsanga-Society).
