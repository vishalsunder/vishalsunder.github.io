I am a PhD student in the [Speech and Language Technologies Lab](https://osu-slatelab.github.io/) at the Ohio State University. I am advised by [Dr. Eric Fosler-Lussier](https://efosler.github.io/). My research interest is Deep Learning, specifically in it's application for End-to-End Speech Understanding in Spoken Dialog Systems.
 
Prior to joining OSU in 2019, I was a Researcher at TCS Innovation Labs, Delhi, where I worked in the Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence group. I was supervised by [Dr. Gautam Shroff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautam-shroff-066901/) and [Dr. Lovekesh Vig](https://sites.google.com/site/lovekeshhome/).
 
From 2012-2016, I was an undergraduate student of Electrical Engineering at IIT (BHU), Varanasi. Here I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Gopal Sharma](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/eee/people/gsharmaeee).
