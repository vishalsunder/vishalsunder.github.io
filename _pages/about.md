I am a PhD candidate in the [Speech and Language Technologies Lab](https://osu-slatelab.github.io/) at the Ohio State University. I am advised by [Dr. Eric Fosler-Lussier](https://efosler.github.io/). I hold a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Varanasi (IIT-BHU). I have over eight years of research experience in industry and academia.

My research interests are Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), End-to-End Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) models.
